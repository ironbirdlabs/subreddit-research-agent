# Security Policy

Please report all security issues privately via **security@agentsystems.ai**. We aim to acknowledge within 2 business days; timelines are aspirational and not a commitment.

## Supported Versions
Only the latest minor release of `agent-template` receives security patches.

## Disclosure
Provide a detailed description and any proof-of-concept. We coordinate public disclosure once a fix is available or 90 days have elapsed.
